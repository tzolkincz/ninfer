# NInfer — two-GPU tensor-parallel fork

> **This is a fork of [Neroued/ninfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer)** that adds an
> experimental two-GPU tensor-parallel mode (`--tp 2 --devices A,B`), so that Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4,
> which does not fit one 16 GB board, runs split across two. It builds on earlier TP2 forks by
> Wael Mansour, natpate, ivanov84 and parallelno; see [NOTICE](NOTICE) for attribution.
>
> - **Covered:** ordinary decoding, `--spec mtp`, `--spec dflash2 --lm-head-draft`, prefix
>   reuse, concurrent requests, CUDA Graph decode and `--vision`, with `bf16` or `int8` KV. See
>   [Two GPUs](docs/cli.md#two-gpus) and [serving](docs/serving.md).
> - **Verified on:** two RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB without peer access, Linux, CUDA 13.1, core clocks
>   capped at about 2.1 GHz. Other GPUs and P2P-capable pairs are untested.
> - **Measured** with upstream's own benchmark suite against the published RTX 5090 runs, same
>   weights on both. v0.2.3 with uncapped clocks (2026-09-28, about 2.9 / 2.8 GHz under load): MTP3
>   decode on structured output 100% of the 5090 (220.0 vs 219.8 tok/s per request at C=1), plain
>   decode 100% (70.9 vs 71.2 tok/s at 7.7k), MTP3 corpus at C=1 98% (157.1 vs 161.1 tok/s),
>   prefill 59% at 7.7k (4,956 vs 8,340 tok/s); with the QUASAR-QAT artifact structured output 116%
>   (254.5 tok/s), plain decode 118%, prefill 72%. v0.2.2 with the core clocks locked at 2.1 GHz (2026-09-28): plain decode 82%,
>   MTP3 77% (corpus at C=1, 123.4 vs 161.1), prefill 50% at 7.7k; with QUASAR plain decode 88-96%,
>   MTP3 75-87%, DFlash2 83%; the lock alone costs about 17% of decode and 14-22% of prefill. Full
>   tables, per category and concurrency 1-8, in [Two-GPU performance](docs/performance/two-gpu.md).
>   GSM8K 0.975-0.985, the same as vLLM on the same weights.
> - **Related forks and prior art.** The two-GPU design originates in Wael Mansour's
>   [ninfer-tp2-1m](https://github.com/wamansou/ninfer-tp2-1m) (August 2026, 2× RTX 5090, YaRN 1M),
>   continued by giocom, ivanov84 (pinned-host mailbox) and parallelno (DFlash2 at tp 2), all
>   credited in [NOTICE](NOTICE). A sibling continuation of the same line,
>   [lynx-gt/ninfer-tp2-5060ti](https://github.com/lynx-gt/ninfer-tp2-5060ti) (upstream base of
>   2026-08-20, qualified on 2× RTX 5060 Ti, KV tiers, `/health` self-heal, no Vision or DFlash2 at
>   tp 2), decodes at the same rate as this fork on the same pair with the official artifact
>   (server-side, MTP3, C=1: 128-144 vs 130-143 tok/s from 0 to 184K context, measured 2026-09-25).
>   What this fork adds on top of that shared core is the upstream v3 base, Vision, DFlash2 and
>   concurrent requests at tp 2, the NVFP4 split projections, and the benchmark suite comparison.
>   A QUASAR-QAT NInfer artifact (with DFlash2) was published first by
>   [MirkoCovizzi](https://huggingface.co/MirkoCovizzi/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-NVFP4-NInfer) (2026-08-26);
>   the one here differs in recipe and components, see its card. Single-GPU ports to other
>   architectures exist too: [Don-Chad/ninfer-3090](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090) (sm_86).
> - `--tp 1` is meant to behave exactly as upstream. The commits on top of upstream are grouped
>   so that they can be proposed upstream in pieces.
>
> **Known limitations of the two-GPU mode** (read these before trying it on other hardware):
>
> - **Hardware.** Verified only on two RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB (sm_120) without peer-to-peer access,
>   on Linux with CUDA 13.1. Other Blackwell GeForce pairs should work but are untested. A pair
>   with peer access keeps its all-reduces on direct copies (the host mailbox is only used without
>   P2P); that path is untested too. Exactly two GPUs: `--tp` accepts 1 or 2.
> - **Windows via WSL2.** Reported working by [@Zeppe79](https://github.com/ValerioDolci/ninfer-tp2/issues/1)
>   on two RTX 5070 Ti (Windows 11, WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04, CUDA 13.1 from the `wsl-ubuntu` repo): build as
>   on Linux and keep the weights on the Linux filesystem; no flag is needed. The pinned-host
>   mailbox works under WSL2 without `--spec` (reported 60 tok/s, against 22.5 on the cross-device
>   copies, whose every hop costs ~220 us there instead of ~17). A full `--spec mtp` round with the
>   mailbox hangs in its first launch instead: the engine then recaptures with the MTP draft phase
>   on the copies and, if that hangs too, with the copies everywhere, and says so in the log
>   (`NINFER_TP_MAILBOX_DRAFT=copies` starts with the draft phase on the copies directly). With the
>   copies everywhere MTP3 was reported at 49 tok/s. Reaching the server from Windows needs a
>   `netsh interface portproxy` rule to the WSL2 address, which changes at every restart.
>   [`tools/tp2/mailbox_probe.cu`](tools/README.md#standalone-tp2-mailbox-probe) tells in seconds,
>   without a model, whether the mailbox works on a machine.
> - **Tuning is per GPU.** The linear-op selectors (A16→A4 crossovers, MMA bands, TMA tiles and
>   thresholds) were measured by upstream on an RTX 5090, and the tp 2 half shapes inherit their
>   parents' settings. On two RTX 5070 Ti the halves cost about half their parents (0.96-1.10× of
>   parent/2 at small T), but the best thresholds differ: A4 from T=3 on the SwiGLU, down and output
>   projections would cut ~5 % of the MTP3 round time at a measured −1.2 pt on GSM8K (500 questions),
>   so only the neutral change (128-token TMA tile on the attention shard at T=1024) is applied. On
>   another board, re-measure with the `bench/ops` sweeps (see [Linear tuning](docs/maintainer/linear-tuning.md))
>   and validate with GSM8K, not only perplexity, which scores in 1024-token chunks and cannot see
>   small-T routes.
> - **Weights.** Verified with the Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 artifact (`qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer`: NVFP4
>   MLP in layers 0-55, FP8 elsewhere) and with an all-NVFP4 conversion of the QUASAR-QAT
>   checkpoint (every large layer projection NVFP4; GDN `a`/`b` decoded to BF16, head and embedding
>   FP8). The split projections take FP8 or NVFP4; the MTP head splits only in Q8. The MoE model
>   and the groupwise-int artifacts are rejected at startup (paired Q4/Q5 input projections have no
>   split route).
> - **Memory per board.** Each board holds half the weights plus its half of the KV cache, so the
>   context and the number of retained conversations trade against each other:
>   - MTP3 runs at 262,144 tokens with 4 device state slots, or at 196,608 with `--vision` and
>     4 slots (the default 8 slots plus Vision do not fit at 196,608); the all-NVFP4 artifact
>     (17.0 GiB of weights instead of 20.9) runs at 262,144 with `--vision` and 8 slots;
>   - the DFlash2 drafter lives whole on the first GPU, so with the official NVFP4 artifact DFlash2
>     stops at about 150,000 tokens; at 131,072 it starts with 2 device state slots. The QUASAR-QAT
>     artifact with the drafter added starts at 196,608 with `--vision` and 4 slots (not at 262,144).
> - **No host tier.** `--host-state-slots` and `--host-kv-mib` must be 0 at `--tp 2`: retained
>   conversations live only in the device state slots. With many conversations in parallel the
>   oldest idle ones are evicted, and their next turn is prefilled again.
> - **Speculative decoding.** DFlash2 needs `--lm-head-draft` and a drafter without
>   full-attention layers (the published drafter has none). `--spec dflash` is not supported.
> - **KV cache types.** `bf16` and `int8` only; `fp8`, `nvfp4` and `k8v4` are rejected.
> - **Where it pays off.** The gain grows with context: prompt processing is 1.5-2.1x and decode
>   1.1x at short context to 1.65x at 184K (1.75x with uncapped clocks) against llama.cpp on the same two boards. On short
>   prose prompts llama.cpp with MTP was about 8% faster. With v0.2.3, uncapped and with `--lm-head-draft`
>   (2026-09-28, against the same llama.cpp numbers): 2.1x on a cold 16K prompt, 1.3x decode at short
>   context to 1.9x at 184K, a 16-turn agent session 44% shorter, and short prose prompts 10% faster.
>   Measured with one request at a time; concurrency is measured up to 8 requests (see the two-GPU
>   performance page).
> - **Numerics.** The split matmuls sum their two halves in a different order than one GPU does,
>   so long greedy generations can drift from a single-GPU run of the same weights. Measured
>   quality matches: GSM8K 0.975-0.98 at `--tp 2`, vLLM on the same weights 0.98.
> - **Profilers.** Inside captured decode rounds the two GPUs wait for each other for at most
>   about 0.8 s; if one stalls longer (a profiler that serializes kernels can do that) the engine
>   stops serving until it is restarted. Use `--no-tp-mailbox` when profiling. At startup the
>   engine exchanges one probe payload through the mailbox before capturing any decode graph; if
>   the probe times out or takes more than 50 ms (WSL2's GPU virtualization is the known case) the
>   mailbox is dropped and the captured all-reduces use the cross-device copies, with a warning in
>   the log. `NINFER_TP_MAILBOX_PROBE=off` skips the probe, `=fail` forces the fallback. A hang in
>   a decode graph's first launch at startup steps the transport down the same way (above) instead
>   of stopping; `NINFER_TP_MAILBOX_FAULT=draft|any` simulates one, for testing.
> - **Upstream.** Based on upstream `e31bc99b` (26 September 2026, merged into the fork base
>   `bace20dc` of 24 September); later upstream changes are merged by hand.

NInfer is a from-scratch C++/CUDA inference engine for Qwen3.5 Dense and MoE architectures on a
single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090. It runs text, image, and video prompts through a local CLI or
OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible HTTP APIs. The runtime is deliberately specialized: one GPU, one
resident model, and a startup-fixed capacity of one to eight active requests.

Five official artifacts are available. The quick-start commands use Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4.

| Model | Weights | Artifact | Download and model card |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B | `groupwise-int` | `qwen3_6_27b.ninfer` | [Qwen3.6-27B](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer) |
| Qwen3.6-27B | `nvfp4` | `qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` | [Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer) |

**Fork note.** This fork adds an unofficial artifact (published by the fork author, not by upstream)
for the two-GPU mode: an all-NVFP4 conversion of the QUASAR-QAT checkpoint (17.0 GiB of weights
instead of 20.9), verified at `--tp 2` on two 16 GB boards. It has no DFlash2 component.

| Model | Weights | Artifact | Download and model card |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.8-27B QUASAR-QAT | `nvfp4` (all large projections), no DFlash2 | `qwen3_8_27b_quasar_nvfp4.ninfer` | [Qwen3.8-27B QUASAR-QAT NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/Feyd89/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-QAT-nvfp4-NInfer) · [card and recipe](model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-QAT-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md) |

Each v3 `.ninfer` artifact carries model configuration, encoded weights, logical bindings and
frontend resources. Runtime execution uses those facts with the implemented model and Op
capabilities. You can also [convert your own weights](docs/weight-conversion.md), reuse an official
recipe or choose another supported mixture of formats.

The current engine requires v3 artifacts. Existing official v2 downloads can be
[upgraded locally](docs/weight-conversion.md#upgrade-an-existing-v2-artifact) without downloading
the weights again.

## Quick start

NInfer requires 64-bit Linux, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (or, with this fork's `--tp 2`, two
16 GB `sm_120` boards such as the RTX 5070 Ti), a CUDA toolkit supporting `sm_120a`,
CMake 3.28 or newer, a C++20 host compiler, Ninja, `pkg-config`, FFmpeg development libraries
(`libavformat`, `libavcodec`, `libavutil`, and `libswscale`), and `libcurl >= 7.85`.
CUDA 13.1 is the validated development toolkit; CMake does not impose a CUDA version floor.
The build rejects CUDA architectures other than `sm_120a`.

Build the product binaries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValerioDolci/ninfer-tp2.git
cd ninfer-tp2

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

**Fork note — two 16 GB boards.** The single-GPU examples below need a 5090; on two 16 GB boards
use the two-GPU mode instead (this is the configuration verified in this fork; `fp8` KV and the
host tiers are rejected at `--tp 2`):

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_quasar_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --tp 2 --devices 0,1 --kv-dtype int8 \
  --max-context 196608 --kv-capacity 196608 --device-state-slots 4 --max-concurrency 1 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --vision --vision-device 0 --max-vision-tokens 4096
```

The official `qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` runs with the same flags (about 2 GiB more per board);
see [Two GPUs](docs/cli.md#two-gpus) for the option reference.

Tests and benchmarks are excluded from the default build. `cmake --preset release` configures
the same product build; `cmake --preset dev` also enables tests and benchmarks and finds a
Python 3 interpreter. Both presets use `build/` and explicitly reset the build options.
Machine-specific compiler and Python paths belong in the ignored `CMakeUserPresets.json`.
See [build organization and configuration](docs/maintainer/build-system.md) for details.

There is no install target. The [Releases](https://github.com/ValerioDolci/ninfer-tp2/releases) page
carries prebuilt binaries for one distribution (see [Releases](#releases)); otherwise run NInfer
from its source build tree.
Python tools run independently of CMake; the standalone HBM probe has its own
[build command](tools/README.md#standalone-hbm-probe).

Download the artifact used by this example with the Hugging Face CLI:

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer \
  qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --local-dir models
```

Start a long-running text/agent server with two active-request lanes and explicit Device/Host
checkpoint capacity:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. A shared 240,000-token Device KV pool serves
admitted requests; two requests run concurrently when their combined reservations fit. The cache
tiers provide two Device checkpoint slots, eight pinned Host State slots, and 8 GiB of pinned Host
KV beyond the two active StateImages.

Send an OpenAI-style request:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with one short sentence."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

Run a one-shot CLI request with a 32,768-token allocation:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode, then give a concise conclusion." \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --max-new 8192 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

Answer content is written to stdout. Human-readable startup/runtime diagnostics and the CLI-owned
reasoning, timing, throughput, memory, and speculative-decoding report are written to stderr;
reasoning and the result report remain unprefixed product output. On a terminal, weight
materialization uses one transient progress line followed by a compact Engine-ready summary.
Redirected stderr receives persistent readable progress without terminal control sequences. Use
`--log-level debug` for complete startup detail. Option and local input errors remain direct command
diagnostics. Use `--messages FILE` and `--vision` for structured image/video input; see the
[CLI guide](docs/cli.md) and [committed examples](examples/cli/).

## Resource-aware long-context reuse

A reusable prefix checkpoint contains KV and the complete continuation state for its exact prompt
frontier. A Device-resident checkpoint resumes directly. Under pressure, the planner weighs Device
retention, pinned Host State/KV, and eviction by immediate restore work and later reuse cost. Active
requests retain their completion reservations.

See [Resource scheduling and context cache](docs/maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md)
for the algorithm and [Serve TTFT benchmark](tools/bench/ttft/) for public-HTTP coverage of hot
reuse, Host resume, eviction, shared prefixes, scheduling boundaries, and multimodal load.

## Performance

Published measurements use an RTX 5090. The [performance index](docs/performance.md) links to
per-model run records and the [measurement rules](docs/performance/methodology.md). The tables
below are excerpts from those detailed results. Qwen3.8 uses FP8 E4M3 row-256 KV;
Qwen3.6 uses INT8 group-64 KV.

### Concurrent MTP3 decode

Saturated decode used CUDA Graphs, MTP3, and one 8,192-token generation per active
request. Throughput uses aggregate committed decode tokens from complete intervals whose actual
decode batch equaled the configured concurrency. Acceptance covers the complete request wave;
these rates are steady decode (tok/s).

| Model profile | C=1 tok/s / accept | C=2 tok/s / accept | C=4 tok/s / accept | C=8 tok/s / accept |

### Single-request serving

The serial serving corpus used CUDA Graphs, a 1,024-token prefill chunk, and five
fixed seeds after warm-up. The table keeps one short-prefill, one extreme-prefill, and one
structured-output MTP3 point for each published profile; the full context and scenario matrices are
linked from each model below.

| Model profile | 7,680-token prefill | 260,096-token prefill | Structured MTP3 decode |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B](docs/performance/qwen3.6-35b-a3b.md#single-request-speculative-decode) `groupwise-int` | 17,705.4 tok/s | 5,247.0 tok/s | 779.6 tok/s |

## Evaluation

Capability scores were measured through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking
enabled, MTP3, and EvalScope 1.9.0 (0-shot, rule scoring, one sample per problem):

| Model profile | AIME 2025 | AIME 2026 | GPQA-Diamond | ERQA | RealWorldQA |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [Qwen3.6-27B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer/README.md) | 86.67% | 93.33% | 86.87% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md) | 93.33% | 93.33% | 84.34% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer/README.md) | 90.00% | 90.00% | 85.35% | — | — |

The Qwen3.6 rows used temperature 0.6 and presence penalty 1.0; the Qwen3.8 rows used temperature
1.0 and presence penalty 0.0. Multimodal evaluation used `--vision` and an 81,920-token context
limit. Text evaluation used 262,144 tokens except Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4, which used 252,928 tokens to
fit the RTX 5090 after weights. Each score is one sample per problem; model cards contain the
correct/total counts and evaluation notes.

**Fork note.** The two-GPU mode and the QUASAR-QAT artifact were checked separately, with lm-evaluation-harness through
the OpenAI route at `--tp 2` on two RTX 5070 Ti (thinking on, MTP3, one sample per problem) and compared
per item against the same weights on vLLM 0.30: GSM8K 0.985 vs 0.975, MMLU-Pro (308) 0.789 vs 0.802,
IFEval (200) 0.870 vs 0.880 — no paired difference is significant (exact McNemar p ≥ 0.48). COMET on
FLORES-200 it↔en equals the official NVFP4 weights served by vLLM (0.885 / 0.891 vs 0.885 / 0.892), and
a synthetic long-context suite at 8k/126k matches the official NVFP4 artifact on this runtime. Details,
sources and limits are in the
[QUASAR-QAT model card](model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-QAT-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md).

## Startup notes

GPU residency is fixed at process startup. `--spec` selects speculative decoding residency, and
`--vision` independently selects Vision residency. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B DFlash can be combined with
Vision; it accelerates generated-text decode after multimodal prefill, not Vision encode itself.

## Releases

Each release ships a tarball `ninfer-tp2-<version>-linux-x86_64-sm120a-<distro>.tar.gz` with the
stripped `ninfer`, `ninfer-serve` and `ninfer-perplexity` binaries, the CUDA runtime library they
link, `serve-tp2.sh` (the two-GPU production profile, environment overrides for host, port,
devices and context) and `SHA256SUMS`; the tarball's own digest sits next to it. The binaries link
the distribution's FFmpeg and libcurl, so they run on that distribution (Ubuntu 26.04 for the
current release) with an NVIDIA driver that supports CUDA 13.1; elsewhere build from source or
use Docker. `tools/release/package.sh` builds the tarball from a Release build tree.

```bash
tar -xzf ninfer-tp2-*.tar.gz && cd ninfer-tp2-*/ && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
./serve-tp2.sh models/qwen3_8_27b_quasar_nvfp4.ninfer
```

## Docker

Build the runtime image on a host with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

```bash
docker build --tag ninfer:local .
```

Mount the downloaded model and run the same example server profile (**Fork note:** Docker is untested
at `--tp 2`; for two boards pass `--gpus '"device=0,1"'` and the two-GPU flags of the quick start
instead of the single-GPU profile below):

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --gpus '"device=0"' \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/models:ro" \
  ninfer:local \
  ninfer-serve /models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

## Capabilities and limits

The official artifacts provide the following capabilities, with optional components enabled at startup:

- text generation with thinking and non-thinking prompt modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- chunked prefill, exact-batch CUDA Graph decode, and startup-bounded batched decode;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- BF16, INT8, FP8, NVFP4, and K8V4 KV storage;
- offline causal-perplexity scoring;
- private and shared exact-prefix reuse with Device/Host State and KV retention;
- model-aware sampling defaults and explicit sampler overrides;
- OpenAI Responses Core, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages, including streaming,
  tools, local response state, token counting, and usage accounting.

The 35B-A3B target additionally supports DFlash with draft windows from one to fifteen for Text and
image/video Vision prompts. Qwen3.8-27B artifacts with the DFlash2 companion weights support
`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7` for the same Text/Vision Engine path, with draft counts 1..15
and either full or optimized proposal heads.

The product boundary remains intentionally small:

- one RTX 5090 (or two 16 GB boards at `--tp 2`, see the note below) and one resident model per Engine;
- a startup-fixed capacity of one to eight active requests with bounded FIFO ingress;
- no request preemption, priority/QoS, active-request swapping, weight offload, multi-GPU beyond
  the experimental two-GPU mode below, or distributed serving;
- one shared startup-fixed KV pool across active requests and retained prefixes;
- model architectures and format/shape combinations use explicitly implemented native paths;
- parsed tool calls are returned to the client; NInfer does not execute tools;
- the in-tree C++ headers are not distributed as an installed SDK.

Note: an experimental two-GPU tensor-parallel mode (`--tp 2 --devices A,B`, see
[Two GPUs](docs/cli.md#two-gpus)) splits a dense model across two 16 GB boards that cannot hold it
alone. It is verified only on two RTX 5070 Ti without peer access and leaves every other point of
the product boundary above unchanged.

`--max-context` is each sequence's logical limit. `--kv-capacity` sizes the shared Main Text KV pool
used by active requests and retained prefixes; `auto` resolves the largest legal capacity at
startup from the memory remaining after weights while keeping 1 GiB of sizing headroom. Explicit
capacities remain fixed for the process lifetime.
