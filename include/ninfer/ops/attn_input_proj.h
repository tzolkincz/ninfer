 * All tensors are contiguous BF16. Shapes are x [5120,T], q/gate [6144,T], and k/v [1024,T].
 * T may be any positive value.
 * The two parent weights are RowSplit [7168,5120] with FP16 scales and group size 64:
 * query_key is Q4_G64_FP16 and gate_value is Q5_G64_FP16. The oracle exact-decodes each row and
 * evaluates every projection naively in FP64 from the represented inputs. The BF16 outputs are
 * promoted and compared directly with those ideal values; final output storage rounding belongs
 * to AttnInputProj's named A16 criterion, not the oracle. Production routes choose their private
 * accumulator and staging precision. Inputs and the four outputs must be mutually non-overlapping.
 * Current registered routes require no transient allocation. The Op has no persistent state side
 * effect.

 * Computes the single-parent Q/K/output-gate/V projection.
 *
 * The parent stores rows in physical order query, key, output gate, value while the public output
 * argument order is q, gate, k, v. Every route writes the four independently contiguous final
 * allocations directly; no packed parent output is materialized. The NVFP4 A4 and FP8 A8
 * profiles may use caller-owned transient storage for their private quantized activation.
 *
 * Registered parent forms are:
 *
 * - Q8_G32_FP16 RowSplit `[9216,2048]`, with row counts `[4096,512,4096,512]`. `x` is
 *   BF16 `[2048,T]`, q/gate are BF16 `[4096,T]`, and k/v are BF16 `[512,T]`.
 * - BF16 Contiguous `[14336,5120]`, with row counts `[6144,1024,6144,1024]`. `x` is
 *   BF16 `[5120,T]`, q/gate are BF16 `[6144,T]`, and k/v are BF16 `[1024,T]`.
 * - NVFP4 BlockScaleK16M128x4 `[14336,5120]`, with the same logical row and tensor shapes as
 *   BF16.
 * - FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16 RowScale `[14336,5120]`, with the same logical row and tensor shapes as
 *   BF16.
 *
 * `T` is the positive token extent of the Op contract. All three policies permit the BF16
 * and Q8_G32_FP16 A16 implementations. NVFP4 uses A16 under A16Only/AllowA8; AllowA4 permits the
 * resolver to select either a qualified A16 route or activation quantization to NVFP4 at every
 * positive T. FP8 accepts all policies at every positive T. AllowA8/AllowA4 permit the resolver to
 * choose a qualified A16 route or private activation quantization followed by A8 Tensor Core
 * computation. A16Only preserves the represented BF16 activation at every positive T; tile and
 * route cutoffs are private implementation choices, independent of speculative block width.
 *
 * The oracle evaluates every projection independently with naive FP64 accumulation from the
 * logical values represented by the persistent weight and BF16 activation. The final four BF16
 * stores belong to the Op's criterion for the selected activation-compute path.
 *
 * `workspace` is caller-owned call-scoped transient storage sized by
 * attn_input_proj_workspace_capacity_bytes(). It must not overlap the input, parent weight, or any
 * output. The Op does not allocate device memory internally.

// communication. For the registered FP8 and NVFP4 parents `[14336,5120]` the shard is
// `[7168,5120]` with row counts `[3072,512,3072,512]`: 12 of the 24 query/gate heads and 2 of the 4
// key/value heads. The shard is never a view into the parent's payload.
//
// Every requirement of the single-parent attn_input_proj() applies per rank at the shard shapes.
// `x[r]`, `w[r]`, the four outputs and `workspace[r]` must be resident on `ec.dev[r]`, and rank r's
// work is enqueued on `ec.dev[r]->stream`. The caller obligation of ninfer/ops/allreduce.h applies:
// inputs staged on a device's legacy default stream must be retired before the call. The form does
// not synchronize, and the caller's current CUDA device is preserved.
