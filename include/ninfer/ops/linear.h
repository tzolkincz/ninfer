/**
 * @brief Applies a bias-free matrix projection independently to every input column.
 *
 * @details The ideal mathematical result is
 *
 * @f[
 *   \mathrm{ideal}_{n,t} =
 *   \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}
 *     \mathrm{FP32Dequant}(w)_{n,k}\,\mathrm{FP32}(x_{k,t}).
 * @f]
 *
 * `out` stores a BF16 approximation of this ideal result under the named numerical criterion for
 * the selected private activation-compute path.
 *
 * @par Logical tensors and layout
 * `x` is contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 `[K,T]`, `w` has logical shape `[N,K]`, and
 * `out` is contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 `[N,T]`. Every logical extent is positive;
 * in particular, `T=0` is invalid rather than a no-op. Dimension zero is stored fastest. The Op has
 * no bias, activation, residual addition, or transpose mode.
 *
 * @par Supported execution domain
 * Registered execution uses RowSplit Q4_G64_FP16, Q5_G64_FP16, Q6_G64_FP16, or Q8_G32_FP16 weights
 * with FP16 scales, block-scaled NVFP4 weights, row-scaled FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16 weights, plus
 * registered contiguous BF16 problems. Each format owns a finite registry of exact physical
 * weight problems and selects its kernel internally; a valid encoding and alignment do not imply
 * arbitrary N/K support. FP8 currently registers `[N,K]` in `{[14336,5120], [16384,5120],
 * [34816,5120], [248320,5120], [5120,6144], [5120,17408]}` at every positive T. The current NVFP4
 * problems register the five non-vocabulary FP8 geometries and accept every positive T. Q8 also
 * registers `[5120,25600]` at every positive T. BF16 registers `[14336,5120]`,
 * `[5120,6144]`, and `[256,5120]` at every positive T. For two-device execution, FP8 also
 * registers the halves `[7168,5120]`, `[8192,5120]`, `[17408,5120]`, `[124160,5120]`,
 * `[5120,3072]` and `[5120,8704]`, NVFP4 registers `[17408,5120]`, `[5120,3072]` and
 * `[5120,8704]`, and BF16 registers `[7168,5120]` and `[5120,3072]`, and Q8 registers
 * `[5120,5120]`, `[7168,5120]`, `[17408,5120]`, `[5120,3072]` and `[5120,8704]` (the MTP halves),
 * and Q4 registers `[65536,5120]` (the half of the `[131072,5120]` proposal head),
 * each at every positive T and resolving to the routes of the problem it halves, except that FP8
 * `[5120,3072]` takes A8 from T=22, as linear_add() over the same half does (NVFP4 `[5120,3072]`
 * takes A4 from T=17 like both its parent and linear_add()). Text and MTP packed-weight problems
 * accept every positive column extent T. Registered Vision problems accept raw-patch P in
 * `{4,8,...,131072}` or merged-token V in `[1,32768]`; a matrix column does not inherently
 * represent a text token. FP32 is unsupported.
 *
 * @par Numerical contract
 * Test fixture code materializes the persistent weight as its logical FP32 dequantized matrix.
 * The one Linear oracle accepts that matrix and the FP32 values represented by the BF16 activation,
 * evaluates every complete dot product with naive FP64 accumulation, and retains the FP64 result.
 * The BF16 output is promoted and compared against that result. Output representation,
 * accumulator precision, activation quantization, staging, reduction order, and kernel schedule
 * are private implementation effects covered by the named tolerance for the selected
 * activation-compute path; none is copied into the oracle. Kernel, schedule, template instance,
 * host launcher, and T region do not create separate criteria inside one path.
 *
 * @par Compute policy
 * `policy` specifies the permitted private activation-compute set. A permission does not require a
 * corresponding low-precision route: the resolved plan may remain A16 when that is the qualified
 * choice. Every policy permits the existing A16 implementations of BF16 and Q4/Q5/Q6/Q8.
 * FP8 accepts all three policies; AllowA8 and AllowA4 permit the private resolver to select a
 * qualified A16 or A8 route for the registered problem and T. FP8 `[248320,5120]` retains A16
 * compute under every policy at every positive T. NVFP4 uses A16 for A16Only and
 * AllowA8; AllowA4 permits the private resolver to select either a qualified A16 route or
 * activation quantization to NVFP4 at every positive T. The selected route depends only on the
 * registered problem and T.
 *
 * @par Workspace
 * `workspace` is caller-owned call-scoped transient storage sized by
 * linear_workspace_capacity_bytes(). It must not overlap x, any weight plane, or out. Linear does
 * not allocate device memory internally.
 *
 * @param[in] x Contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 input matrix `[K,T]`.
 * @param[in] w Logical weight matrix `[N,K]` in a registered persistent format and layout.
 * @param[out] out Contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 output matrix `[N,T]`. It must not
 * overlap `x` or any weight plane.
 * @param[in] policy Permitted private activation-compute profiles.
 * @param[in,out] workspace Caller-owned transient arena.

// Tensor-parallel forms over two devices.
//
// Both forms compose the single-device linear() above; neither is a separate kernel. A shard is a
// standalone `[N,K]` weight of the same registered format with one axis narrowed, never a view
// into its parent's payload, so the existing kernel run against a shard reads only that device's
// bytes and resolves the shard's own registered problem. The shard shapes must therefore be
// registered problems of the weight's format; an unregistered shard shape is rejected exactly as
// an unregistered whole shape is.
//
// Every requirement of linear() applies per rank. `x[r]`, `w[r]`, `out[r]`, `staging[r]` and
// `workspace[r]` must be resident on `ec.dev[r]`, and rank r's work is enqueued on
// `ec.dev[r]->stream`. The caller obligation of ninfer/ops/allreduce.h applies: inputs staged on a
// device's legacy default stream must be retired before the call. Neither form synchronizes, and
// the caller's current CUDA device is preserved.
