// ninfer::ops - pinned-host mailbox transport for the two-device TP2 collectives.
//
// A PeerMailbox owns the pinned host memory and the per-device words the mailbox exchange (see
// src/ops/kernel/peer_exchange.cuh) runs on, and the choice of exchange kernel: the pipelined
// kernel by default, or the original one (PeerExchangeKernel::Legacy; the Program selects it with
// NINFER_TP_MAILBOX_LEGACY=1 for A/B runs on one binary). Both combine with the same arithmetic,
// so the choice changes timings only, never a result bit. Attached to a PeerEvents instance
// (PeerEvents::attach_mailbox), it becomes the transport of that stream pair's CAPTURED
// allreduce_sum calls whose payload fits a slot: one exchange kernel per device instead of the
// staged path's two event-ordered cross-device copies and two combines. Eager calls, oversized
// payloads and allgather_rows stay on the staged path, whose results the mailbox reproduces bit
// for bit.
//
// MEASURED ON A TRANSPORT-DEGRADED PAIR (2x RTX 5060 Ti, Windows 11 WDDM, no P2P, original kernel):
//   staged event path (graph replay):   ~277 us per 10 KiB reduction
//   mailbox exchange (graph replay):     ~41 us per 10 KiB reduction
//
// LIFECYCLE. The owner (a Program) creates the mailbox once, before capturing any graph that
// uses it (cudaHostAlloc and cudaMalloc are neither stream-ordered nor capturable), attaches it
// to its PeerEvents, and destroys it only after every graph executable captured with it: the
// captured kernels bake in the slab and word addresses.
//
// SLOTS. Captured exchanges take slots round robin (take_capture_slot()). The epoch protocol
// makes two slots sufficient for any sequence of captured exchanges and graph launches (see
// peer_exchange.cuh, SLOT REUSE), so the slab never runs out and repeated or abandoned captures
// leak nothing. The only preconditions are those of every captured decode graph: its launches
// are issued on one stream, and every launch executes each captured exchange on both devices.
//
// FAULTS. A poller that waits too long for its peer (kPeerSpinLimit, qualified below the 2 s display
// watchdog by test_allreduce) gives up, skips its combine and sets a sticky hang word;
// hang_reported() exposes it to the owner, which fails that round and every later one.
