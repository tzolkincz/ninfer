// own stream (the mirrored KV page and table updates of the round), so the launch is gated on it.
// Nor is work issued on rank 1's stream after the launch ordered behind the graph's rank 1 nodes;
// every caller synchronizes both devices right after, and rank 1's stream is gated on the launch
// as well so that ordering does not rest on that discipline alone.
// Captured mailbox all-reduces need no host step per launch: their epoch flags advance with every
// launch on both ranks, and ProgramImpl::synchronize_devices() reports a timed-out exchange.
