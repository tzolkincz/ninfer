// ninfer::ops::detail - the kernels behind the pinned-host mailbox transport for TP2 collectives.
//
// TRANSPORT CONTRACT (why this exists). Without peer access a cross-device cudaMemcpyAsync is
// staged by the driver through host memory, and the event chain that orders the staged copy costs
// far more than the payload. An exchange kernel pair replaces the whole choreography: both ranks
// run one kernel CONCURRENTLY, publish their operand into their own pinned host slot, release a
// flag, spin on the peer's flag, then sum locally -- no events, no copy engine, no driver round
// trip inside the exchange. Measured on 2x RTX 5060 Ti under Windows 11 WDDM: ~41 us per 10 KiB
// reduction (graph-replayed) against ~277 us for the staged path.
//
// TWO KERNELS, ONE TRANSPORT. peer_exchange_pipelined_kernel (the default) and the original
// peer_exchange_sum_kernel (kept verbatim, selected by NINFER_TP_MAILBOX_LEGACY=1 for A/B runs on
// one binary) move the same bytes and combine them with the same arithmetic; they differ only in
// how the protocol is split across threads, so a mailbox runs exactly one of them for its whole
// life (PeerMailbox::kernel()) and the two never share a slab.
//
// The original kernel publishes the WHOLE payload behind one flag per slot: every block fences,
// meets the others on a device-scope arrival counter, and the last one releases; each thread then
// moves its four 16-byte vectors one at a time (the in-place stores keep the compiler from
// overlapping the next load with them), so a publish costs four dependent VRAM loads and a read
// four dependent PCIe round trips. The pipelined kernel makes each WARP an independent mailbox
// lane with its own flag and epoch, loads all its vectors before storing any, and overlaps its
// first probe of the peer's flag with its own publish; see the second EPOCH PROTOCOL below.
//
// EPOCH PROTOCOL, ORIGINAL KERNEL (per slot and rank; see PeerMailbox for how slots are assigned).
//
//   every block, before it arrives:   target = epoch + 1     (epoch: this rank's count of
//                                                              completed publishes of this slot,
//                                                              in this device's memory)
//   publish:  every thread stores its 16-byte payload chunks to the rank's host slot
//             __threadfence_system()          -- payload stores leave this GPU for system memory
//             __syncthreads()                 -- the block meets
//             thread 0: arrival.fetch_add(1)  -- acq_rel, device scope
//             the block that completes the arrival count (every block fenced and arrived):
//                 arrival = 0, epoch = target
//                 mine_flag = target          -- release, system scope
//   consume:  thread 0 spins until peer_flag >= target (relaxed system loads), then an acquire
//             fence; __syncthreads() hands the acquire to the whole block, and every thread reads
//             its peer payload chunks (ld.global.cv) and combines.
//
// Both ranks execute the same schedule, so each slot's epochs advance in lockstep: execution n of
// a slot publishes n on both ranks and waits for n from the peer. A flag left at n - 1 by the
// previous execution never satisfies the wait, so the protocol needs no host reset between graph
// replays and no host synchronization between launches. (A 0/1 flag would: without a reset the
// second replay would see the first replay's 1 and read a payload the peer has not republished.)
// Comparisons are wrap-safe.
//
// SLOT REUSE. A rank reaches exchange k + 2 only after it observed the peer's publish of k + 1,
// which the peer issues after its exchange k finished reading. Consecutive exchanges on two
// alternating slots therefore never overwrite a payload or flag the peer still reads, and
// exchanges of successive graph launches are separated by the launches themselves (a graph
// launch completes on both devices before the next launch on the same stream starts).
//
// HANG GUARD. A poller gives up after kPeerSpinLimit probes, or earlier once another exchange
// already reported a hang, sets the pinned hang word and skips its combine. The Program reads the
// word after every round's device synchronization and fails the round (PeerMailbox::
// hang_reported()); the word is sticky, because the ranks' results have diverged.
//
// ARITHMETIC. The combine is the qualified residual_add body: FP32 accumulation of the two
// represented BF16 operands, one round-to-nearest-even on store. This matches the staged path's
// local combine bit for bit (the same two partials, the same order, the same rounding), so the
// mailbox transport cannot change a single output value.

// memory):
//
//   publish: lane 0 reads target = epochs[w] + 1; every lane loads its G partial vectors (all in
//            flight), then stores them to the rank's host slot; __syncwarp() orders the warp's

//            semantics at system scope (one fence.acq_rel.sys, cumulative over the warp barrier).
//   consume: lane 0 polls peer_flags[w] with ACQUIRE system loads (ld.acquire.sys: no fence
//            instruction on this path, unlike the original kernel's relaxed polls plus fence)

// Lockstep holds per (slot, warp) exactly as per slot above: both ranks run the same exchanges
// with the same geometry, so a warp lane that an exchange of a slot leaves unused is skipped by
